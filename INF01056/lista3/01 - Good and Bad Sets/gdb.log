Not confirmed.
Step one instruction, but proceed through subroutine calls.
Usage: nexti [N]
Argument N means step N times (or till program stops for another reason).
Step program, proceeding through subroutine calls.
Usage: next [N]
Unlike "step", if the current source line calls a subroutine,
this command does not enter the subroutine, but instead steps over
the call, in effect treating it as a single source line.
Step program until it reaches a different source line.
Usage: step [N]
Argument N means step N times (or till program stops for another reason).
Step one instruction exactly.
Usage: stepi [N]
Argument N means step N times (or till program stops for another reason).
Continuing.
